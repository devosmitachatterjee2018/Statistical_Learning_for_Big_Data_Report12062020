## Context
The assignment is a part of the course 'Statistical_Learning_for_Big_Data', course code MVE441 at Chalmers.

## Project 1
A dataset is being provided containing 
- the training feature matrix (X_train) of order 323 * 800.
- the training binary response vector (y_train) of order 323 * 1.
- the validation feature matrix (X_valid) of order 175 * 800.
- the validation binary response vector (y_valid) of order 175 * 1.

The project is to analyse the data with two different classification methods on the training dataset, compare the methodsâ€™ performance on the validation dataset, determine the best predictors for classification, and explain the selection.

## Responsibilities for project 1
- Perform an exploratory data analysis in order to understand the dataset by summarizing their main characteristics, either statistically or visually.
  *  Data size
  *  Data type
  *  Missing data
  *  Duplicate data
  *  Constant columns
  *  Distribution, count and variability of the binary response variable.
